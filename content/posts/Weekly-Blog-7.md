Welcome to our team's weekly blog! Competition is quickly approaching, and our team has been working diligently to ensure we're ready to go. 

This week, the major focus was on sealing the drone's electrical tube without leaks and verifying the functionality of the electronics. The electrical team made ethernet cable modifications for more efficient competition time and enhanced wiring connections for improved usability and issue detection. Our software team continued to work on ROS codes while supporting the electrical team. The mechanical team collaborated closely with the electrical team to address any new challenges. 

We're all excited and motivated as we move closer to the competition. Stay tuned for more updates on our progress!
