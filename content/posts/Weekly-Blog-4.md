Welcome to our team's weekly blog! The team has been diligently preparing for the upcoming RoboSub competition, and we're excited to share our progress with you. 

This week, our mechanical team has been focused on modifying the mounts required for the thrusters, sonar, and lights. After fine-tuning these mounts, we successfully integrated them into the robot's main frame. Additionally, we finalized the downward camera mount and securely attached it to the frame. In parallel to these robot advancements, we've also been dedicated to enhancing our pool testing environment. To achieve optimal performance underwater, we have successfully printed specific images on waterproof materials and reinforced them with grommets for added support.

In parallel to the mechanical endeavors, our brilliant electrical team has been meticulously preparing the components for the upcoming pool tests. They have diligently conducted comprehensive testing procedures to guarantee the reliability and functionality of each component. Inevitably, during the testing phase, unforeseen challenges emerged regarding the thrusters. Our adept team swiftly sprang into action, investing time and effort into troubleshooting and devising solutions to overcome these unexpected hurdles. Their dedication and expertise have been crucial in ensuring that our robot operates successfully.

Meanwhile, our software team has been making remarkable progress in developing high-level behavioral trees for autonomous decision-making. They have been immersed in coding C++ files, to create sophisticated algorithms that will guide our robot's intelligent decision-making processes. Moreover, with the commencement of pool testing, the software team has actively engaged in the annotation process for computer vision. By meticulously analyzing and labeling the gathered images, they are laying the foundation for advanced visual perception, enabling our robot to navigate the competition tasks with precision and accuracy.

In conclusion, our team has been dedicatedly working on a daily basis, united by our shared goal for the end of July. We're motivated and committed to achieving success in the RoboSub competition through our ongoing efforts and collaborative spirit.
